# ENCRYPTION-AND-DECRYPTION-OF-MESSAGE-FOR-MILITARY-APPLICATIONS
It is the process of translating plain text data into something that appears to be random and meaningless(clipher text)
Decryption is the process of converting cliphertext back to plain text.encryptioon refers to any process used to make sensitive data more secure.
less likely to be intercepted by those unauthorized to view it,
It allows you to securely protect data.
The goal of every encryption algorithm is to make it as difficult as possible to decrypt the generated cliphertext without using the key.
Longer the key,the more difficult is to decrypt a piece of cliphertext.
The secret key,being secret cannot siply be exchanged over a public communicatin channel like internet.
Almost all encryption method rely on a key.
Key can be number or string of characters or both.
